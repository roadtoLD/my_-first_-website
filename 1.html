        <p> Samba TV confirmed that over 1.9 million households watched Dune: Part One the weekend it was released. This number is higher than both Zack Snyder’s Justice League, which received a streaming exclusive release and was watched by 1.8 million households in its first weekend, and the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical In the Heights, which was simultaneously released in theaters and was only watched by 700,000 households.</p>

        <p style="margin-inline-end: 45px;">That’s not to say the sci-fi epicdidn’t also perform well at the box office. The first of Villeneuve’s planned Dune adaptations brought in $40.1 million, which may not sound like a lot for a movie of this size but it was actually the biggest opening weekend for Warner Bros. in 2022. Globally, the tally is even more impressive, raking in $401.8 million worldwide.

        All these factors must have convinced the studio to finally greenlight Dune: Part Two.</p>
